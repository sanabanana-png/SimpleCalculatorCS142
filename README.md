# SimpleCalculatorCS142

To get this Simple Calculator up and running, open up your favorite Java IDE (or download one of your choice!)
Then, go to "src", and download the two classes that are in there (or copy and paste the code into two separate classes on the IDE of your choice, making sure they're named "Main" and "Calculator", respectively)
